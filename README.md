# Mock API
This is an example Mock API for rapid front-end development.

## Quick Start

```
yarn install
yarn run start-mockapi
Load http://localhost:3001/clients
```

## Next Steps

Generate GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests against the mock API and note that changes are saved to db.json, so they're reflected on refresh like a real database exists!
